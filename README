= About =

andreth is a basic _And_roid _re_verse te_th_ering script that will allow your
Android powered device to use the LAN connection of your linux box to connect to
the internet.


= Prerequisites =

You'll need
 * the Android SDK on your linux box[0]
   * a working adb setup[1]
 * the ability to execute commands as root on your maschine[2]

You need to enable
 * USB debugging[3]
on your device.


= Disclaimer =

I stole the information on how to make Android use reverse tethering over USB
from xda developers[4] and wrapped them in this small script. All props to them.


= More Information =

In case this script is too basic for your needs, you can find more information
here[5][6].

Obviously I would be glad if you forked this project, patched the script and
sent me merge requests so everyone may profit from your enhancements. Thx.
